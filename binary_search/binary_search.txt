For most tasks, we can transform the requirement into the following generalized form:
  Minimize k , s.t. condition(k) is True

  def binary_search(array) -> int:
    def condition(value) -> bool:
        pass

    left, right = min(search_space), max(search_space) # could be [0, n], [1, n] etc. Depends on problem
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if condition(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left

What’s really nice of this template is that, for most of the binary search problems, we only need to modify three parts after copy-pasting this template, and never need to worry about corner cases and bugs in code any more:
  Correctly initialize the boundary variables left and right.
    Only one rule: set up the boundary to include all possible elements;
  Decide return value. Is it return left or return left - 1?
    Remember this: after exiting the while loop, left is the minimal k satisfying the condition function;
  Design the condition function. This is the most difficult and most beautiful part. Needs lots of practice.
